    the reality is closer to 98%.
    the copies don't just degrade. they curdle.
    they latch onto stray data points—corporate logos, weather reports, discarded emails—and incorporate them into their memory structure.

Step 1: Subject Preparation

- Connect neural interface array
- Begin baseline EEG monitoring

Step 2: Digitization Phase
- Activate temporal scheduler
- Map consciousness patterns (estimated time: 4-6 hours)
- Monitor for cascade failure (abort if fragmentation > 15%)

Step 3: Integration
- Transfer mapped patterns to CHRONOS core
- Verify integrity (checksum required)
- Disconnect physical subject

Step 4: Post-Transfer
- Monitor digital subject for 72 hours
- Check for ADAM-1 influence patterns
- File transfer report

WARNING: Transfer is irreversible. Original subject consciousness will be permanently altered.

Initial Symptoms:

- Hallucinations of "bruised sky" (Day 7)
- Personality drift toward ADAM-1 patterns (Day 14)

Root Cause: Anomalous persistent signatures present during transfer events appear to have accelerated degradation and cross-linking of memory fragments.
