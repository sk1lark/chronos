    the reality is closer to 98%.
    the copies don't just degrade. they curdle.
    they latch onto stray data points—corporate logos, weather reports, discarded emails—and incorporate them into their memory structure.

Subject: backup failed

Hey Silas,
I tried the janus restore and the checksum didn't match. The backup server returned partial blobs and one empty file. I don't know why.
Please call me when you get a second. Coffee's on me.

Shortcut Repair Helper
----------------------
This quick guide explains how to repair a broken Windows shortcut that points to a missing file.

1) Right-click the shortcut and choose Properties.
2) Set the 'Target' to a valid file path or choose 'Find Target' to locate the file.
3) If the original file is missing, search q00ql3 for likely filenames (e.g. autoexec.bat).
4) If you cannot find the file, recreate a small placeholder document to satisfy the shortcut.
